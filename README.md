## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The project is built using the Medallion Architecture approach, which organizes data into three main layers:

### 🥉 Bronze Layer
- Stores raw data as received from source systems  
- Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server  
- No transformations are applied  

### 🥈 Silver Layer
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling missing values and duplicates  
- Standardization and normalization  

### 🥇 Gold Layer
- Contains business-ready data  
- Structured using Star Schema  
- Optimized for reporting
